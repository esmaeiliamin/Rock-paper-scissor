# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a Python-based implementation of the popular game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". It provides the opportunity to play the game against a computer, which makes its moves based on random choice. The project is a meaningful exercise for students who already grasp the Python basics and want to dive into something more challenging and hands-on.

## Project Structure
```

## Requirements
1. Python 3.7+

## Running the Project
To run the project:

```python
python src/game.py
```

## Hints
- This project is built around a main class, `RockPaperScissors`, which encapsulates the game's functionalities.
- For the computer's choice, consider using the `random` module of python.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon the successful completion of this project, students will have gained:
1. A better understanding of Python classes and object-oriented programming (OOP).
2. Experience with Python’s `random` module.
3. A deeper understanding of game loop and user interaction.
4. Experience with troubleshooting and problem-solving their own code.
